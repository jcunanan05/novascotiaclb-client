**Your child could be eligible to receive up to $2,000 in free money for their post-secondary education from the Canada Learning Bond (CLB).**

If your child is eligible, the Government of Canada will deposit the money directly into a bank account called a Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP). All you have to do is register.

You donâ€™t have to pay fees or put any money into the RESP for your child to receive the CLB.
