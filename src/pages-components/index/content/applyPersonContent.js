You can get help filing taxes, getting SINs for your children and register for the CLB at a walk-in tax clinic. Clinics are being held around the province in April.

  footer: processMarkdown(`
If you canâ€™t attend one of these clinic, you can get help with your taxes at another free tax clinic in your community. These clinics are for taxes only, not for SINs or the CLB. Visit the Community Volunteer Income Tax Program for more information.

## Before You Start

When you register for the CLB, make sure you have:
 
* Social Insurance Numbers (SIN) for you and your child
* Your most recent income tax and benefit return
* An RESP account where the government can deposit the money.
